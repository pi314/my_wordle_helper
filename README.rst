My Wordle Helper
===============================================================================

My wordle Python implementation and a built in helper.

Need Python3 or above.

.. code:: sh

   $ python -m wordle

The helper's algorithm was from 3B1B's `Solving Wordle using information theory [v68zYyaEmEA] <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v68zYyaEmEA>`_ .

::

  $ wordle               # play a random wordle (only from past)
  $ wordle .             # play today's wordle
  $ wordle 2021/06/19    # play 2021/06/19 wordle
  $ wordle 123           # play wordle #123

(WIP?, hope I can finish this)
